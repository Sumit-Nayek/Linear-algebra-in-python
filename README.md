##  Overview

This repository presents implementations of basic linear algebra operations in Python—such as dot products, matrix multiplication, solving linear systems, vector spaces, and more—designed to reinforce understanding in the context of machine learning labs and educational exercises.

---

##  Features

- Core implementations of linear algebra operations using pure Python and/or NumPy  
- Clean, modular structure: e.g., `vector.py`, `matrix.py`, `solvers.py`, `notebooks/`  
- Annotated Jupyter notebooks with visualizations (if present)  
- Educational comments and docstrings explaining mathematical concepts  

---

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Recommended packages (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, docx etc.) if used:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
